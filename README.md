Demo Flask project for connecting with the Gmail API

Usage:
1. Make sure to put in your own client_secret.json file in the credentials folder
2. Open up your browser console and server console for the action
3. Your will need to change the paths specified in the config.py file (I'll remove the config files in future commits, I promise!)
4. Dont judge me by the code, I'm only learning 

Happy Flasking!
